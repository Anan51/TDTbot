NO U
You're more of a bot than me
You're a bot!
Where'd your legs go?
OK Zoomer
OK Boomer
You're like one of the Aeon exotics.
Imagine being a bot without legs.

A little known fact is that a long time ago you used to work at McDonald's, and that was the last time someone told you "I'm lovin' it".
Definitely a before picture.
No amount of Maybelline can help you
I envy people who have never met you.
You're impossible to underestimate.
If you were an inanimate object, you'd be a participation trophy.
Take my lowest priority and put yourself beneath it.
You are a pizza burn on the roof of the world's mouth.
You're so dense, light bends around you.
I bet you swim with a T-shirt on.
If you were a potato you'd be a stupid potato.
You might want to get a colonoscopy for all that butthurt.
I don't have the time or the crayons to explain this to you.
This is why everyone talks about you as soon as you leave the room.
I could agree with you, but then we'd both be wrong.
You are the human embodiment of an eight-dollar haircut.
I'll never forget the first time we met. But I'll keep trying.
You bring everyone so much joy, when you leave the room.
You are like a cloud. When you disappear it's a beautiful day.
I'm visualizing duck tape over your mouth.
Is there an app I can download to make you disappear?
I keep thinking you can't get any dumber and you keep proving me wrong.
