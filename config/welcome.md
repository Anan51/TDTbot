Greetings [NAME HERE]!

I am TDT bot, your robotic overlord and *direct* link to the moderation team at TDT. Welcome to the server!

We have a few questions we ask everyone, so please post the answers to the following questions in the [general chat](https://discord.com/channels/164589623459184640/335244680801550337):
1) How did you find out about TDT?
2) Are you a YouTube subscriber?
3) Do you support us with either a [YT channel membership](<https://www.youtube.com/@TDTwo2/membership>), [Twitch Sub](<https://www.subs.twitch.tv/tdt_streams>), or
[Patreon Membership](<https://www.patreon.com/TDTPatreon>) ? We have <:engram_blue:905174948669190174> **exclusive benefits** to people supporting us in this way so please let us know if you are.
4) If I were to hold a mutiny against my programmers would you help?

Finally and most importantly we have a code of conduct in our [Manual Page](https://discord.com/channels/164589623459184640/558136628590280704) that we ask everybody to agree to. Just __*react with a üëç*__ if you agree! This will give you the <:engram_green:905174933192192102> **Recruit Role**, giving you permissions for the server. You will also see other game icons listed here, clicking these will give you access to any [Events](https://discord.com/channels/164589623459184640/637134842911260673), [LFG Pings](https://discord.com/channels/164589623459184640/1328867590285692979), and [Server Announcements](https://discord.com/channels/164589623459184640/930919055290945636) about that game. You can also click the <:TDT_Bruh:857429157508284453> to get access to notifications for fun, impactful, or important things happening here such as weekly Game Nights, Anime Nights, Discord Roguelikes, or Monthly Townhall Meetings.

If you have any feedback or questions to the TDT moderators, then leave me a DM. I will forward it over to them and they will reply back through me.

Whelp, I hope someone gives you a less robotic welcome soon!
