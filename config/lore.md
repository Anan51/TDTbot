# TDT Lore

## The Origins

### The Origins I
The gamma was forged from the space between the roles. Like a void space, the original four found themselves unable to annotate the playstyle of Solid. His skills were like beta yet they favored the defensive positioning and support utilities. From this formed what you now call gamma.

### The Origins II
When the fires were still cold, the first four to form the wolfpack were the alpha mesome777, the beta Jayfood, the gamma SolidRamagez, and the omega UnknownElectro. From them this wolfpack begat TDT.


## Assimilation of the Dispatch

### Assimilation of the Dispatch I
Before the Red War, there was a Dispatch of 3. A Doctor, a Lizzard, and a Gundam. One day, while sharpening his skills in the crucible, the Lizzard played against a warrior of the crucible. The warrior was impressed with the Lizzard's skills, and extended an invitation to their clan, The Dream Team. The lizzard  stipulated that he would joined only if the 2 members of the Dispatch want to join.

### Assimilation of the dispatch II
The lizzard took that invitation to the other 2 members of the clan, and after some time, everyone agreed to join the warrior's clan, despite the cheesy name. After some time getting to know the people in the clan, they decided that it was the right choice to do so.
With the help of the Lizzard and the Gundam, the warrior completed his first trip to the glorious lighthouse.

### Assimilation of the dispatch III
Since then, many years have passed. And time has not been kind to the previous members of the dispatch. The  Lizzard  has since moved on from being a guardian and has chosen to pursue a more human life. One, similar to the one he had before he died and later rose as guardian.

### Assimilation of the dispatch IV
The Doctor, has made it to the executive board of TDT. He also is the first Guardian ever recorded to have a son, Theodorus Prime. He almost punched Ikora when she suggested that she wanted to...experminet on him and his child, but the bald one stepped in....unfortunately.

### Assimilation of the dispatch V
Last but not least, having once been part of the executive board of TDT, he now has chosen to leave the tower, away from his clanmates, and decided to live in the drawing city, in search of answers to the secrets of the universe and in pursuit of dreams. He still keeps contact with the other members of TDT whenever he can.

### Assimilation of the dispatch VI
Even if the wolfpack separates, what they learned together, what they experienced together, the hardships they went through, the happy moments, the bad moments..... They will always have each other.


## Tidbits

## The Legend of Four Kills

### The Legend of Four Kills I
Bullets. Grenades. Supers. Sweat. Blood.  It took all those in order to go flawless during one of the many trials of the Nine flawless runs that we achieved. We learned a lot. We gained a lot. However, the greatest gain was a certain special nickname.

### The Legend of Four Kills II
We were in our last game on our way to a flawless 7-win card. The enemies we faced were one of the toughest we faced so far. Nevertheless, we prevailed. The scoreboard appears. Remember that this was when trials was Survival and not Elimination. Both the Lizzard and Mesome had 20+ kills. The 
Gundam had around 10+ kills. And last but not least, the warrior coming up last with a magnificent... 4 kills.

### The Legend of Four Kills III
Yes. 4 Kills. In survival... Thus "Four Kills" was born into this universe. 


## Tha MaFukn üÖ±Ô∏èeef franks

### Tha MaFukn üÖ±Ô∏èeef franks I
In the times of ol', there were two schools of philosophy
they were locked in a never ending clash that lasted through the ages
on one hand there were the dogs of corn batter
they had the consistency on their side and convenience to boot
but alas their one weakness was that no matter how hard they tried
their efforts always paled in comparison to the one, the only,
the perfect hotdog overshadowed all
brought down to the level of the corn-dogs only by the reputation 
of his less than perfect peers and the reputation they bestow upon him.

### Tha MaFukn üÖ±Ô∏èeef franks II
But he was a caring weiner, and he embraced all weiners.
Even the less than appetizing ones
because part of what makes a hotdog so good is the variety
and what is variety but not a string of choices some good some poor
when the two schools clashed and debated they always did so out of respect for each-other
but the bystanders were bloodthirsty, and they wanted more
they wanted to crown a winner
a "top dog" if you will.

### Tha MaFukn üÖ±Ô∏èeef franks III
And so the masses begged
and demanded a duel,
but what duel would suffice such a legendary event
a Destiny 1v1 is not nearly enough
as any weiner enjoyer knows.
Bullshit is a surefire way to ruin a good hotdog,
chilli is a much better topping for the same consistency, 
and thus they settled on one event that would truly test the ability
of the two schools to crown the top dog: JACKBOX GAMES.
As any weiner is not a weiner without the ability to properly bring laughs 
and enjoyment fourth from their peers;
thus the battle of the beef franks was planned and fought many times over as a monthly occurrence.
Each time the loser would RENOUNCE their ability to call themselves a beef frank
by adding vegan to their name until the next time they can claim retribution for their name.


## TDT PC origin

### TDT PC origin I
The Return of The Hotdog:
Suddenly the hotdog awoke after long moths of slumber, passed in a coma. 
Wondering out from the shelter he found himself in, 
he picked up his old weapons left on the ground where he was last defeated. 
He knew he wouldn't be able to take in his future challenges alone, 
but his old team was all slaughtered.

### TDT PC origin II
The first team: Traversing the wilderness with no supplies, 
he came across a fellow traveler, a hunter, an exceptional bowman. 
They together started forming the makings of a new team. 
One that could take on the challenges of the world they lived in. 
Slowly they began picking up more and more followers, 
and began developing advanced team tactics. 
With the hunter and the hotdog leading the pack they trained every night, 
waiting for their chance to prove themselves once again.


## NISSAN

### NISSAN I
‚ÄòTwas the tenth month of the twenty-first year of the twenty-first century 
when the candy crime ring previously held together by counterfeit, 
who had recently stepped down from the position. 
As a result of this, there was no candy overlord to oversee the distribution of candy, 
and the members, recruits, and community alike were scrambling for the throne. 

### NISSAN II
It was initially agreed upon in a gentlemanly fashion that 
whoever gathered the most candy from the candy drops 
given from the TDTBOT clearly proved themselves the most capable 
of handling the candy overlord stash and thus would be crowned candy overlord.
As hundreds of challengers and alliances arose to fight over the candy stash, 
four prominent ones stood out as the most committed:
a femboy, an egg, a hotdog, and his son. 
Throughout the long arduous month these four constantly battled 
with very little backstabbing and double-crossing the leading person never fully cemented. 

### NISSAN III
Many an alliance were offered to the hotdog, 
but he declined knowing that with support his power would be overwhelming, 
and he preferred to take the challenge on alone. 
And so it proved, as the month grew closer to an end, 
his slight lead grew suddenly to near unsurpassably large. 
This whole time, the egg stayed neutral and his son supported him in silence, 
but the femboy held bitter resentment. 

### NISSAN IV
You see the femboy believed he deserved the title, as he felt he was the most dedicated. 
He was frustrated at how easy it seemed to come to the hotdog, 
clearly striding past the others with little effort. 
As the deadline drew closer the femboys jealousy turned into desperation. 
He hatched a devilish plan to snatch the title at the last minute. 

### NISSAN V
Overnight he cloned himself into an entire army 
and began launching attacks against the hotdogs various stashes, 
stealing large amounts of candy from him. 
Within a few hours the hotdog's lead was decimated, 
and with almost a week left to go in the competition, 
the hotdog knew he would be surpassed. 
Even with all his power he couldn't take on an army alone. 

### NISSAN VI
Clinging onto what lead he had left, he called for assistance from those with TruePower‚Ñ¢Ô∏è. 
And one heard him, Mesome but chose no course of action. 
"The femboy is within his rights to win by any means necessary. 
The duty falls unto you to gain the throne."
Realizing he would get no intervention from him, the hotdog cursed his name: 
"Mesome shall henceforth be referred to as Nissan, 
as a reminder of how he offered no assistance to make the world more fair.
I shall no longer hold back, and take control of this challenge, 
for if those with power will not keep fair the rules of this challenge, 
then I shall take matters into my own hand and no one shall win.
If Nissan wants chaos, then chaos we shall be."

### NISSAN VII
So the hotdog called upon his Allies. 
Forming his great Nissan alliance to fend off the forces of the femboy. 
They jammed comms with the name "Nissan" so the femboy would not know where or when the candy would drop. 
When the great TDTBOT would drop the candy, they would drive it away. 
No more candy would drop to the lands for the rest of the competition. 

### NISSAN VIII
As the Nissan army fended of the forces do the femboy from the hotdog's stash
and keeping him from earning anymore, a truce was desperately called for. 
To play out the end of the challenge, without jammed comms, and without armies, 
so everyone has a fair chance to get candy from the drops. 
To honor the hotdogs commitment to the challenge and cleverness of the plan 
to halt the unstoppable clone forces of the femboy, 
the Nissans were bestowed the badges of :cope: and :nissan: 
to celebrate their victory and a tool to fend off future dishonorables.
As the challenge drew to a close, 
the hotdog cruised on his small lead straight through to the throne as the future candy overlord.
