# TDT Lore

## The Origins

### The Origins I
The gamma was forged from the space between the roles. Like a void space, the original four found themselves unable to annotate the playstyle of Solid. His skills were like beta yet they favored the defensive positioning and support utilities. From this formed what you now call gamma.

### The Origins II
When the fires were still cold, the first four to form the wolfpack were the alpha mesome777, the beta Jayfood, the gamma SolidRamagez, and the omega UnknownElectro. From them this wolfpack begat TDT.

## Assimilation of the Dispatch

### Assimilation of the Dispatch I
Before the Red War, there was a Dispatch of 3. A Doctor, a Lizzard, and a Gundam. One day, while sharpening his skills in the crucible, the Lizzard played against a warrior of the crucible. The warrior was impressed with the Lizzard's skills, and extended an invitation to their clan, The Dream Team. The lizzard  stipulated that he would joined only if the 2 members of the Dispatch want to join.

### Assimilation of the dispatch II
The lizzard took that invitation to the other 2 members of the clan, and after some time, everyone agreed to join the warrior's clan, despite the cheesy name. After some time getting to know the people in the clan, they decided that it was the right choice to do so.
With the help of the Lizzard and the Gundam, the warrior completed his first trip to the glorious lighthouse.

### Assimilation of the dispatch III
Since then, many years have passed. And time has not been kind to the previous members of the dispatch. The  Lizzard  has since moved on from being a guardian and has chosen to pursue a more human life. One, similar to the one he had before he died and later rose as guardian.

### Assimilation of the dispatch IV
The Doctor, has made it to the executive board of TDT. He also is the first Guardian ever recorded to have a son, Theodorus Prime. He almost punched Ikora when she suggested that she wanted to...experminet on him and his child, but the bald one stepped in....unfortunately.

### Assimilation of the dispatch V
Last but not least, having once been part of the executive board of TDT, he now has chosen to leave the tower, away from his clanmates, and decided to live in the drawing city, in search of answers to the secrets of the universe and in pursuit of dreams. He still keeps contact with the other members of TDT whenever he can.

### Assimilation of the dispatch VI
Even if the wolfpack separates, what they learned together, what they experienced together, the hardships they went through, the happy moments, the bad moments..... They will always have each other.

### Tidbits III
On the sixteenth day, of the twelfth month, in the twentieth year, during the twenty first century, a brave Guardian bid farewell to his comrades as his visage vanished into the mists of the wilds. His journey, one of physical pain and mental suffrage, left him battered but better then ever before. His name was Zerothyme, and the wisdom he brought back with him was shared with the masses.
