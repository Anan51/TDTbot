**__Abandoned Chest__**
- You are sneaking your way through the streets, hoping none of the creatures or Higuard notice you when you come across a small, strangely secluded room with a chest sitting on the far wall. The pace looks abandoned save for a few piles of bones here and there... was this some kind of old dungeon?

tdt$chest_leave

You decide to leave the chest. Something doesnt feel right. (do another encounter)

-------------
tdt$chest_listen

Something in the air clues you in that this isnt a normal chest. You perk up your ears, close your eyes, and listen. You hear the sounds of the wood creaking. The sounds of the waterway rushing outside. The drops of the the Ether seeping in through the stone walls. The sounds of... breathing... Its faint, but you can identify that that breathing is coming from the chest. Its a mimic. You have heard about these and you know how to deal with it. You stand up as tall as you can and begin clanging your weapon on the ground and growling and roaring. You bear your fangs and make as much noise as you can. After a little while, the mimic begins to slowly back away towards a hole in the house, revealing a pile of gold where it was digesting (gain 10 gold)
