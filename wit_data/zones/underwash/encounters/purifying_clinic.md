**__Purifying Clinic__**
- The street ends at a unkempt medical clinic... at least you think it is. There is a small line of weary and sick looking people out front and a haphazardly placed cross above the door painted in some kind of red paint. A few volunteer guards are standing outside making sure no one decides to try anything drastic. They are under-armed.

"I might be able to help you and your cause" you say to an old woman wearily trying to take care of the line of people. "That-" she looks at her guards "That would be fine, but you need to lay down your weapons." You are nervous about leaving your weapons out in such a public place, but it would be worth it if you can help.

"You ask the woman if you can sit and observe how she works. She is clearly skilled in medicines and also working the more complicated machinery. She is hesitant. You offer some gold and keys in exchange for her inconvenience" (You may spend 10 <:gold:1058304371940655185> and 1 Higuard Key to gain ||: __Scholar__ :brain:  "Succesful moves with ðŸ”€ overwrite the left side to the right for this combat"|| lasts for the rest of this run)
