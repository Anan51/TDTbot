**__Crying Child__**
- You are making your way long the streets when a group of children come out to meet you "Please adventurer" one little girl with golden hair cries out "You have to help us!" The other children look horrified at her. "what areyou doing?" one of the boys say ot her. She keeps looking towards you "Please. Our friend, she's very sick.. she has..." The girl chokes down a sob "She has Necrosis. The doctors wont even see her please she-" the girl covers her face and tears pour through her fingers

tdt$child_leave

You tell the little girl you cant help. "But why!" She cries out holding back sobs. You tell her necrosis is too dangerous and she should find a doctor. "The doctors wont help" she says. You say that you are sorry, but neither can you. ( Gain: __Cold__ :snowflake:  "Take and give 1 less __Healing__ and +:heart:" )

tdt$child_help

You nod and go into the the shack the girl is standing outside of. Inside the situation is dire. The room is dimly lit with candles that are struggling to stay lit under the influence of the necrosis. A woman, about 16-20 years old is neck deep in the thick black substance, its beginning to pin her to the wall and it looks like it has already overtaken her feet completely. The womans hands are restrained to the bed. shards of glass bottles dot the ground, some of them with bits of dried blood on them. "It felt so good at first." The woman says "I wasnt hurting anyone, it just brought me pleasure. Isnt life about finding pleasure?" A chill runs down your spine. "Let me guess, you are going to tell me that this is wrong?" You stare blankly "That I am not allowed to feel this way." You hear something whisper in your mind...

(You can either use your mana to try to sever the woman from the necrosis (!r 1d20, anything below a 12 is a success and you lose 2 stacks of __will__) or you can coax the necorsis onto you (gain 5 stacks of __Will__, gain a Higuard key))

THIS MAN IS GOING TO TRY TO HURT ME!" she cries out. The little girl doesnt waver. You walk forward and stretch out your hand towards her head. The chains holding her in place rattle wildly as she tries to reach for bits of broken glass bottles scattered along the floor. You place your hand firmly on her hand and invoke a prayer to YHWH. "NO PLESE! SPARE US! WE NEVER HARMED THE CHILDREN" The womans voice is desperate. A light gleams from your hand as the necrosis scatters or evaporates. You open your eyes to see the woman no longer gripped with the black substance. Shes sobbing. You release her chains. The little girl runs towards her and puts her arms around her. The womans wrists are purple with bruising. The lights flicker as the girl turns towards you and says "Thank you." Her tears no longer stain her shirt. (Lose 10 stacks of __Will__)
