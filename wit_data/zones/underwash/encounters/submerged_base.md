**__Submerged Base__**
- Your feet clank against the metal stairs as you enter into the concrete structure the woman on the street corner told you to pass through. Pulling aside the large metal door, you are greeted with the heavy scent of hard water, rust, and the strangely sweet smell of the glowing blue liquid that flows through the underwash like its blood stream. You step inside, not minding the barrage on your senses, but after lugging the door shut again your turn around to behold a massive man made basin filled to the brim with that strange liquid. You unconsciously whisper a "wow" to yourself as your eyes strain to see end boundaries of this unbelievable construction. You glance down from the top of your scaffolding and see a thin metal bridge stretching across the surface of the liquid connecting to a singular port hole about 300 meters out into the liquid. At this moment, you are yet again tossed into combat against your curiosity and your better judgement...

You cautiously descend the stairs and plant your feet on the bridge. Manually, you put one leg in front of the other all the while eyeing the glowing blue liquid 20 meters below you. The bridge groans like it has been awoken from hibernation and you halt in place begging it to return to its slumber. The beast eventually settles back down. You wait a moment longer before raising your foot again when suddenly the metal bridge thunks, clangs, then begins to fall away behind you. You glance back for a moment only vaguely watching your once solid ground plunge into the liquid with a loud splash. You bolt for the port hole, your feet continuing to stress the bridge and create more ripples of rust giving way to gravity. You run with all your might as if some great beast was hungrily chasing you down before finally leaping onto the port hole. You catch your breath before examining the structure... then your heart sinks. The door is locked with a Higuard security measure. ( ||Pick the lock :game_die: ≤ 8 : fail and you are forced to swim through the liquid, dropping a weapon in the process, automatic success if you have a **Higuard Keycard** 💳 | :game_die: ≥ 9 : theres some abandoned loot in here! use `tdt$wit_loot 19`||)

You shake your head, mostly in dissapointment with yourself. You walk past the bridge onlooking like watching an old friend leave. You continue to follow the metal catwalk which winds its way along the wall of the concrete basin, all the while the gentle glow of the blue liquid illuminates your steps from below. You round what you calculate to be the final corner before the exit when your eyes catch a large fallen away gap in the catwalk, forcing you to halt with a sudden fright. You look along the rest of the path and see the exit, barely visible from the faint blue glow. You look down at the liquid below. Your eyes strain against the on coming light but you think you make out... red? Red in the blue. You furrow your brow. That looks like quite the fall... and quite the jump... (||Parkour :game_die: ≤ 6 : fail fight the enemy below but it skips your first turn as you have disadvantage in the liquid | :game_die: ≥ 7 : skillfully manuver the gap and continue about your way||)

You dont even hesitate. Your strap your gear as close to your body as you can and leap clear across the scaffolding into the liquid below. It has been a while since you have had a pool of water large enough for this. You let the joy and elation course through you as you cant help but smile. You realize you have been instinctually holding your breath.. In fact... come to think of it... are you sure you can breathe this stuff? Is it even water? There is a brief moment of panic as you realize that worse case scinario you can tread water- er... liquid- and get back out. Your blood pounds in your skull as you overwrite your insticts and... 

||You breathe in. A strange surge of new energy fills your lungs. This isnt JUST water, this is something else. Something better. The blue liquid reacts with your DNA.. it feels like it empowers you. Embraces you with strength... then you feel something in your mind change. Like an ancient tablet of knowledge your mind is suddenly full of your species history. Ambition. Pride. Deceit. Conflict. Rebellion. Regret... Lonliness... It assaults your will like a warzone and along with it, you can feel your DNA wanting to fight back. Reject it. The urges seem strangely familiar. Your eyes dart back to the surface. Its pulling away from you as you feel a slow building pressure on your body. Are you... drowning?||
