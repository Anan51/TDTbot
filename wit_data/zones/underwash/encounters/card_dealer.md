**__Card Dealer__**
- You pass by a small collection of people gathered around a a wooden box with some cards on it. On the other side of the box a man with a shaggy coat and white gloves is slinging the cards here and there then asking a disheveled looking fellow on the other side to take a guess. The man thumbs his chin for a bit then reluctantly motions for more cards "OOOoh." The card slinger cries, "Looks like its not your lucky day." The card dealer pockets some gold then he sees you standing there. He eyes up your gold pouch then says "Come on over stranger. Take a card!" (Roll !r 2d11)

tdt$card_trick

You suspect trickery is at play here. You eye the amounts being rewarded and being taken and you realize there is about an 80% chance you will lose which doesnt make sense. You watch closely then discover the secret: the man is playing with a trick deck. You are impressed at his cunning if not slightly disgusted at his thievery. You decide to wait a while until everyone else clears out then you ask him to teach you his tricks... for a price of course. (||You may spend 20 <:gold:1058304371940655185> to gain: __Gilded Tongue__ :money_with_wings: "Shops are now 5 gold cheaper, gain 1 <:gold:1058304371940655185> per excess damage on kills."|| for the rest of the run)
