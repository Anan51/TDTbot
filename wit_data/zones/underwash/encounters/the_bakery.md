**__The Bakery__**
- You stopped at a nearby bakery to try to order some food. You havent really seen this bakery before in your travels, but you figure it could be a good opportunity to recover. There are some locals inside, some you recognize from previous crusades, all looking over the selections. The bakery is just as grimey and disheveled as the rest of the Underwash but the owner has clearly put some love and care into this place. You grab some bread and head back out when you realize you are not in the underwash anymore.. in fact... where are  you?

tdt$bakery_look

You look around bewildered. A strange blackish fog begins to form familiar shapes around you. You feel a tiny tingling sensation in your spine as you begin to realize you are back on The Reach. A sudden fear grips you when, suddenly, you hear the familiar sounds of enemies approaching. ( Summon 2 Reach enemies. Each player in a team fights them separately. If you beat them you find a way out of this reality)

-------------
tdt$bakery_explore

You decide not to hesitate. You immediately set off to find out what's going on although the more you explore, the more reality around you seems to get weirder... (Do a Reach encounter, your dice roll has -3 to it.)

Your smile sinks into a scowl. Something is not right here and you know it. You can feel that the timeline is weaker here. You gather your strength and attempt to will the timeline back to its rightfull state. (Roll a d20. Anything above a 10 and you return to your previous place... with some bread (+2 HP and MP). If you fail you *must* spend 1 MP and HP to try again.)
