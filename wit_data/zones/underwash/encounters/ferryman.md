**__Ferryman__**
- You approach the edge of a slow moving river of clear blue and green liquid. The river stretches from the inside of a pipe in a massive concrete wall to miles down the waterway. You arent going to be able to go around... A man with a cloak standing on top of a small flat raft approach you. "Do you seek to cross?" You cant see his face but you can tell the tone of his voice is one of a tired, withered old man. You nod, forgetting he likely cant see your face either. Nevertheless he responds "You are the ones who broke the seals?" Your pulse quickens for a moment but you slowly reply, "Y-yeah." He doesnt move "Perhaps it is time..." He holds out his hand expectantly.

-------------
tdt$ferry_gold

You dig through your pocket in search of gold. While you are doing so, the man says "He did not bring the curse" This gives you pause, but you keep looking (pay 20 Gold or 2 Higuard Keys, if you dont have the currency use tdt$ferry_spirit)

-------------
tdt$ferry_spirit

You dont elect to provide any currency. You decide to instead grasp his hand. This feels like what was intended, strangely. The man grips your hand firmly and says "He knows you will kill if it gets you more renown or experience" (Gain Will x3)

-------------
tdt$ferry_blood

You examine the mans hand. You notice it has tattoos in old elvish. You dont speak it, but you strangely seem to understand what they are saying. You place the edge of your blade in your hand and cut it. It begins to bleed. You drip some of the blood onto the ferryman's hand "Sacrifice is the only cure" he says. The tattoos recede and he retracts his hand. (-2 :heart: max, travel straight to the gates)
