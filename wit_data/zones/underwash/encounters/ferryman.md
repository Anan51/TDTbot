**__Ferryman__**
- You approach the edge of a slow moving river of clear blue and green liquid. The river stretches from the inside of a pipe in a massive concrete wall to miles down the waterway. You arent going to be able to go around... A man with a cloak standing on top of a small flat raft approach you. "Do you seek to cross?" You cant see his face but you can tell the tone of his voice is one of a tired, withered old man. You nod, forgetting he likely cant see your face either. Nevertheless he responds "You are the ones who broke the seals?" Your pulse quickens for a moment but you slowly reply, "Y-yeah." He doesnt move "Perhaps it is time..." He holds out his hand expectantly.
