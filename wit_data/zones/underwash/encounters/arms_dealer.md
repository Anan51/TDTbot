**__Shady Shop__**
- There are far too many corner shops in the underwahs for you to count, however one in particular catches your eye "Markus' Arms and Armors". The place of buisiness (if you could call it that its basically a metal box) is adorned with brown and green riveted painted steel, a few scandelously dressed women on posters, and lots and LOTS of bullet holes You walk up to the reinforced counter with thick bullet proof glass and the rotund man with aging hair and a well kept beard says "Welcome to my humble shop!" with a devious smile

The man gives you a nod. He turns around and presses a button below the counter that responds with a *beep*. Behind the man unflods a set of massive metallic shudders that reveal a haul of confescated goods from the hands of dead adventurers (use  `tdt$wit_shop` if you have 3 higaurd keycards you can exchange it for :dagger: **High Guard**: :shield:, +:shield: per missing :large_blue_diamond:.

Above the display case in the back of the shop you notice a dwarven metal gauntlet. Its size and dimensions are too large and too heavy for most people to hold, but you know what you could be capable of with this (You may spend 30 <:gold:1058304371940655185> to gain: ||__Dwarven Supplex Gauntlet__ :boxing_glove: "You can spend bonus turns to instead throw one enemy into another, dealing damage equal to their current HP|| lasts for the rest of this run)
