**__A Strange Sound__**
- You are about to cross over a bridge when you notice that it is out. It looks to have been abandoned for years. After some debate you head towards a large pipe that runs parallel to to the blue river above in the cave ceiling. As you are crossing through, making small splashes in the dirty green water, you hear a strange noise coming from behind you... You stop and listen... Is that?.. WATER! and LOTS of it!

tdt$flood_run

You begin a full sprint towards the exit. The water is crashing against the metal pipes behind you as you hear the pipes respond with metalic groans from the weight. The pipe ends in a sheer drop to a drain, there is light shining through it. It will hurt, but you might be able to smash through it and get clear on the other side (üé≤ ‚â§ 5 : -2 ‚ù§Ô∏è -2 üî∑)

tdt$flood_branch

You see an off shoot of the main pipe directly above you with a ladder leading up, you muster your strength and jump up to reach it just in time for the watter to blast through the pipe below you. Your feet get drenched, but you are fine. You climb to the top and push off the metallic cover only to see you are now in the middle of an enemies camp...

tdt$flood_brace

You eye up the water coming towards you and glance behind you to see a drain isnt far off. You scan your environment and see there is a drain above you but the tunnel is too small for you to fit. You decide your best bet is to grab the ladder above and brace for impact. The water is intense, but nothing you cant handle. Despite it being murky, the water smells like only algae inhabits it, and its cool against your skin. (Gain +5 üî∑)
