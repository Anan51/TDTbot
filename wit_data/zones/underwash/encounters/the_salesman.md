**__The Salesman__**
- "Potions! Get your high quality Ether Potions here! Finest in the underwash! Straight from the Judges tap!" You are intrigued. You walk over to the man and realize that he is no human. Half of his body has been spliced together with some kind of rat-like Fenric. Below patches of some of his fur are orange scales that, if you didnt know better, looked like scabs. He sees you eyeing him over and says "Hey there. You look like the type that could use a quality potion or two. Here:" he holds out a small flask "On the house." You take a bit of the flask and inquire what it does, the salesman replies "Wonderous things!"... you're dubious

tdt$salesman_sip

You take a timid sip of the liquid. The salesman eyes you over with a smirk on his lips. You begin to feel... something... You look back up to see the salesman has vanished

You drain the flask into your stomach with gusto. The salesman cant help but cackle. "tastes good right?" his mouth flops open and he drools at the thought. He begins to sniff the air "ahhh yes you're in for a ride"

tdt$salesman_smell

You look the salesman in the eye. Your gaze makes him cower slightly. You take a sniff of the flask while maintaining eye contact... the salesman is visibly sweating. "This is a transformation tonic. I can smell my peoples blood in it. Its unmistakable" The salesman begins to fidget with something in his pocket "ahh well, y-you see... th-this is specially designed for uhh-" You hand the liquid back to him "If you wish to leave here alive you better get rid of this right now" His eyes grow wide, then narrow back down and a sneer crawls across his face. "and what are ya gonna do if I dont?" In flash you kick a nearby box into the ally and light it ablaze with a gust from your lungs. Fear grips him as he recoils back. "I-I'm sory I-I-I will g-get rid of it! H-here! Take it! Im sorry! Its yours!" he drops a relic on the table, hastily drops the flask, and scurries away on all fours.
