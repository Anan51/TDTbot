**__Quarantined Zone__**
- The underwash has interesting smells. Often times its a sweet but stale smell from the blue liquid, other times its the faint scent of sewage, and other still its a slight hint of herbs and bread. This time however, it smells like chemicals. The type of chemicals only used in a few places, most of them surrounding something dead. The scent is growing stronger as you are stopped by a large blocked off street. Personnel dot the borders of a large yellow and white dome with yellow paper tape crisscrossing the entrances reading "DANGER BIO HAZARD"

tdt$zone_around

You decided to follow the orders and detour around the site. Unfortunately this will set you back pretty severely. (Go back 5 levels)

tdt$zone_sneak

You dont have time to waste. You wait for the staff to look away then you cross under the tape and head inside the dome. Inside black and pinkish sludge are growing along the walls. The smell of chemical has fully given way to the smell of rot. You instinctively cover your face. Bodies are strewn about the zone, with some of their corpses slowly climbing up the walls from the sludge. The room in here is well lit with florescent lamps that seem to be dissipating some of the sludge where it is most concentrated leaving a large amorphous scab where it has dried up. Some site containment crews are looking at equipment and scanning the room with strange devices. Others are collecting samples. The longer you stand in here the more you begin to feel light headed... You head for the door.. (:game_die: ≤ 3 : summon 2 Reach enemies | :game_die: ≥ 4 : lose 1 max HP and 1 max MP, gain one stack of __Will__)

tdt$zone_sun

You peer through the sheets of the dome's door and see that they are using high intensity lights to clear the infection. You have a bit of sunlight saved from the Reach, you decide to release it here to help them out (Spend 4 :large_blue_diamond:)
