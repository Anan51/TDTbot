**__Hoisted Sack__**
- Your walking through a man-made trail when a brown sack hanging from a tree catches your eye. Its extremely high up and will take a bit of dexterity to get it down. Or you could just leave it be.

tdt$sack_search

You remember using this trick yourself back when you were younger. This is to keep away wild animals which means there is probably a camp not too far nearby. Sure enough after a bit of searching you find an elvish camp. It seems it has been overtaken by some thugs but there is still an Elvish scroll bound around a book that they werent capable of opening.
