**__Hoisted Sack__**
- Your walking through a man-made trail when a brown sack hanging from a tree catches your eye. Its extremely high up and will take a bit of dexterity to get it down. Or you could just leave it be.

:bow_and_arrow: Elvish: ||**Intuition** tdt$sack_search||

-------------
tdt$sack_climb

You gather your strength then attempt to reach the sack dangling from the branches. ( ðŸŽ² â‰¤ 4: summon enemy | ðŸŽ² â‰¥ 5: !r 1d5 lesser chest)

-------------
tdt$sack_leave

You leave the sack. Its probably someone's stuff anyways... (Go back one floor)

-------------
tdt$sack_search

You remember using this trick yourself back when you were younger. This is to keep away wild animals which means there is probably a camp not too far nearby. Sure enough after a bit of searching you find an elvish camp. It seems it has been overtaken by some thugs but there is still an Elvish scroll bound around a book that they werent capable of opening. (You may spend 2 :heart: to upgrade your Elvish passive to: __Pure Blood__ :woman_elf: "While an enemy has __Weak__ they cannot cause __effects__")
