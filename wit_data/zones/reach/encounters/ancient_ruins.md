**__Anchient Ruins__**
- While you are trecking through some dense bruch you open into a thicket surrounding an old copper ruins. The structure sits about 9 feet tall and 30 square feet round, the dome's copper shell has weathered over the years but its white marble walls still remain mostly intact. You listen for anything moving at the sound of your approach but the place seems vacant... You debate if its worth risking a look inside.

tdt$ruins_enter

You figure the ruins couldn't be harboring anything more dangerous than you have already fought. Inside you find it to be some kind of old work shop with vacant tools not designed for human hands scattered around the tables and benches. The inside is still pretty torn up but interestingly a still warm fire pit in the middle betrays this ruin's vacancy. You look up and see that the roof has a shiftable skylight and that there also appears to be doors but they seem rusted open. You decide this would be a safe spot to try to camp for the night, although as the night draws closer the walls seem to come alive around you...

You let out a sigh. As nice as a roof over your head would be you are certain you couldnt have been the only person -or creature- that found this place. (continue to the next floor)

You venture inside with a skip. You place your hand along the ancient doors and wonder at the survival of this ancient Sullen outpost. Inside you find tools that clearly belonged to some of the first generations of Sullen, as they are still designed for aquatic apendages. Your eyes catch glimps of some still usable, albeit rusty, scrap. You are excited but only for a moment because you remember that you have nothing to power anything you make... that is until you see the flasks... You snatch up a handful of flasks and beakers and pray the chemicals are still active. To your glee, they still react, eveen if slowly and unoptimally. After a sleepless night of metalwork, alchemy, and desperately trying to remember your schooling you succesfully reassemble and power an old Sullen mechana.
