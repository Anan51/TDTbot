**__Clingweed__**
- The bone has fallen away here. Previous travelers have set up a rudimentary bridge to cross the gap. You begin carefully crossing over the pit when something sticky brushes against your leg. You try to pull your leg through it but the more you struggle the more it sticks to your flesh. Your movement awakens more of this Clingweed to your presence and its reaching tendrils are closing in on your position FAST.
