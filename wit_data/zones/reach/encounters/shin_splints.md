**__Shin Splints__**
- You are rather mindlessly walking along the worn path. The sun is beating down against your head through the ravine of trees. You are keeping your eyes on the path but when you looks back up you see a field of bone-forged spears planted and fastened into the ground. The spears are pointed towards your approach, and they look sharp.

tdt$shin_remove

You squat down along the first row of spears, they are crudely made BUT not flimsily made. You recognize a few of the markings and knots used on the fastenings; they are fenric. "That makes sense" you say out loud to yourself. You think you might be able to remove one of the spears
