**__Fork in the Road__**
- As you continue through the forest, you come to a choice on paths. You can chose to go left which onlooks an array of strange looking plants and trees or right which leads to a rickety bridge. There is another path straight forward but it seems to lead to an outpost which some local bandits have set ablaze.
