You beckon the woman to stand behind you and prepare for a fight. (Summon a Major, gain a permanent stack of __Protect__ if you win)

tdt$traveler_smoke

You fire a smoke bomb behind the woman. She is fearful at first but understands your intent a moment later. You call her over to a hiding spot. She obeys. Once on the other side of the smoke, the enemies cannot find you and decide to give up. "You saved me." she says with a thick romanian accent. You look down at her and say nothing. "Please..." she fumbles through her bag "take one" she offers you a potion (gain one !r 1d10 potion)
