**__Desperate Traveler__**
- A woman with a broken weapon comes sprinting towards you. She looks panicked and scared. "HELP!" She cries out "Someone help!" you look past her and see a band of vicious looking creatures chasing after her

tdt$traveler_ignore

You clearly make eye contact with the woman, but dip behind a tree to avoid detection by her pursuers. You are racked with guilt (Gain: "__Fearful__ :rooster: Start each combat with __Vulnerable__ for the rest of this run")

tdt$traveler_fight

You beckon the woman to stand behind you and prepare for a fight. (Summon a `tdt$reach_major`, Change the rewards of the fight to: "**Badge of Protection** ðŸ“› gain a stack of __Protect__ at the beginning of every combat for the rest of this run")

-------------
tdt$traveler_smoke

You fire a smoke bomb behind the woman. She is fearful at first but understands your intent a moment later. You call her over to a hiding spot. She obeys. Once on the other side of the smoke, the enemies cannot find you and decide to give up. "You saved me." she says with a thick romanian accent. You look down at her and say nothing. "Please..." she fumbles through her bag "take one" she offers you an item (gain `tdt$wit_loot 5`)
