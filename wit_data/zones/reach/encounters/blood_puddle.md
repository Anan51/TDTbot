**__Blood Puddle__**
- As you continue through the forest, you come to a small grove of trees that are unlike the rest. These trees have red leaves and trunks and they are particular swarmed with insects... more than normal. You breach the thicket and find a puddle of blood. You remember hearing that that Giant's Marrow is a rare resource.
