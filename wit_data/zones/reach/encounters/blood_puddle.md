**__Blood Puddle__**
- As you continue through the forest, you come to a small grove of trees that are unlike the rest. These trees have red leaves and trunks and they are particular swarmed with insects... more than normal. You breach the thicket and find a puddle of blood. You remember hearing that that Giant's Marrow is a rare resource.

-------------
tdt$blood_leave

You decide to leave the pool alone and let nature figure out what to do with it (proceed to the next floor)

-------------
tdt$blood_drink

Something inside you feels drawn to this liquid. Almost instinctually you go down to one knee. You can see your own reflection in dark red liquid and you swear its looking at you differently than you are looking at it. You hesitantly cup your hands and drink from the pool. It taste bitter but you feel it resonate with your pulse. (||gain +1 max :heart: and +1 max :large_blue_diamond:||)
