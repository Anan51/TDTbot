**Blind Beggar**
- A man sat next to a small caravan perks up as you approach. "Oh please, champion." the man says in a dehydrated voice "spare some coin for a blind man?" You look the man up and down. He is wearing a tattered yellow shawl with withered greyish brown shorts.

tdt$blind_gift

You give the man a coin and go about your way.

You purse your lips at the man. You pat your satchel to make sure it hasn't been lifted and go about your way.

-------------
tdt$blind_threaten

You deftly draw your weapon on the man. He doesnt respond. You know this man isnt trying to trick you. You say a quick prayer then you give the man some money. He hears the coins hit the bag and says "oh thank you! May YHWH bless your kindness. (You may spend 20 :gold: to gain: __Angel__ :rosette: "Protect persists, taking damage removes __Protect__ first" for the rest of the run)

-------------
tdt$blind_hostile

You deftly draw your weapon on the man. Despite the weapon making no noise the man reacts immediately "wait!... I m-mean." You brandish your weapon aggressively at him, "What a sorry excuse of a human, faking blindness. You disgust me. Get out of here! Go on!" The man springs to his feet and scrambles away in a hurry, leaving 2 coins behind (+2 <:gold:1058304371940655185>)
