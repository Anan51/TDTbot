**__A Hole in Reality__**
- You are passing by a familiar trail (one you like taking when you are doing a crusade) when you hear something odd. A humming sound mixed with a chorus of water. Turning to your right you see a strange portal. It looks unstable but it doesnt seem to be growing any larger. It secretes a strange black smoke that splashes softly against the grass and bone ground. You can barely see inside and you see...  some mean looking creature on the other side.

You arent scared of no water loving creature! You reach inside that portal with your left hand while holding onto the edge of the portal with your right. You fish around for a moment, making a series of different faces -some of them more attractive than others- before finally pulling the creature out and giving a good punch
