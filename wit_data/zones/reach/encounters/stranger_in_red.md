**__Stranger in Red__**
- Night has fallen on the Reach. The redwings begin to sing their nightly calls and a cool breeze sweeps across your face. Under the moonlight you see someone approaching you. They are clad in a red sat cloth hood with a black velvet lining. You ready yourself for a possible attacker. You ready your voice to hail the stranger when he speaks up, "Hello, nightwalker. Are you in need of coin?" the voice is raspy but soothing. You look into the strangers face to see a fang adorned smile from an older looking man with black hair and pale a complexion.

Your look the stranger squarely in his eyes. "How long have you been this way?" The man staggers at your question as he looks you over before returning back to look at you "Since I was a boy." he mutters. "Then you should know better than to resort to this." you reply. The man doesnt move. The man struggles to find his voice "But I will die." "So you would rather ruin the lives others so that you can live?" you reply sharply "You dont know m-" the man starts "I am one of you." you retort, reaching your hand out to the moonlight, your hand flaking skin off into the breeze. The man lowers his head "We are YHWH's mistake." "I dont think He makes those." You reply with a smile and a pat on his shoulder. The man sighs. You spend the next few minutes exchanging stories as you walk. The man guides you through a shortcut he uses to get through the thick brush. (Skip ahead 2 floors.
