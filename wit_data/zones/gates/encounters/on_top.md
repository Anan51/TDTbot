**__On Top__**
- You were forced to scale one of the many underground mountains in order to proceed. Its much harder to climb a mountain when its so dark... but you manage. You are nearing the top when you spot a mound of rocks laid in a pile which overlooks the peak. Stuck out of the pile is a singular plank of wood. Nothing else seems to be of any significance

**Remove the pile and search** tdt$top_search
**Consider it a Warning** tdt$top_warning

-------------
tdt$top_search

You think that perhaps the pile is meant to be someones burried treasure. You begin removing the stones to uncover what little remains of a skeleton. Its bones are fractured and gnashed. You immediately realize this was meant to be a grave... but you are too far at this point not to take what you came for. (Gain 1 __Will__ and a 1d10 weapon)

-------------
tdt$top_warning

You dont quite understand what these stones mean but you figure them to be a warning. You let out a heavy sigh and begin to trek back down the mountain. (Go back 2 floors.)

-------------
tdt$top_respects

An immense reverence and sadness overtakes you. You kneel down in front of the grave. "I hope you died in a glorious battle. The homeland mourns the loss of a great warrior." (gain permanent __Empower__ and __Vulnerable__).
