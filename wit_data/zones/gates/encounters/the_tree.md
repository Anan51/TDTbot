**__The Tree__**
- There is a certain unbearable heat that emanates from within the gates. As a result most plantlife around it is small or withered, but as your are mulling this thought over, before you stands a tall fruit tree. It looks surprisingly well kept despite its environment. You look around and see only some wildlife lurking about its branches. The tree pulses with a sort of dark energy that you arent sure would be healthy to partake of... but you could REALLY use some food right about now...

-------------
tdt$tree_eat

You decide the tree is good for food and pleasant to the eyes. You pluck a fruit off and eat a bite. (Restore 100% :heart: and :large_blue_diamond:, enemies roll first in your next fight. Gain permanent __Healing__. Gain __Will__x10)

-------------
tdt$tree_leave

You think that the tree is too good to be true. You decide to leave it be... however the wildlife seems to have noticed this as a perfect opportunity to make you into a feeding frenzy.   (Summon 10 `tdt$champions_landing_enemy` )

-------------
tdt$tree_prune

You notice the tree has branches that arent bearing any fruit. You carefully reach up and snap off the branches. You also decide its likely best if the tree got some sunlight so you also release some onto the tree. (If you encounter the tree again, eating the fruit will not cause __Will__ for the rest of this run.)
