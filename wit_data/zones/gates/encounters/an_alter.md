**__An Alter__**
- You come to a large mountain that looks impassible, thankfully jutting out of its face is a small temple entrance. You cautiously walk inside. Its still well lit with torches and there is a faint scent of death in the air. In front of you lies a large round stone alter about 3 feet high and 1 foot in radius. A dried blackish substance rests along the top of the rocks. Around the alter is a chiseled grove which runs to two closed doors to your right and left. Behind the alter is a man on his knees with his hands outstretched above his head... You know you need to offer SOMETHING on this alter for the doors to open, but what?

You hesitantly rake out a weapon and lay on the alter. You stand there for a while until you hear the sound of stone door grinding open to your right. (Remove one weapon from your inventory. If you dont have one, do a major fight.)

You take a closer look at the alter. You notice that the strange dried substance along the stop used to be blood. Its darkish like this from being set ablaze. You breathe deep and let out a gust of flames that ignites the blood yet again. The stone statue's eyes behind the alter light up as it rolls out of the way revealing a shortcut. (Skip ahead one extra floor.)
