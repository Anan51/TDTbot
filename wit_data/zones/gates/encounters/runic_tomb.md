**__Runic Tomb__**
- You stumble into what seems to be some kind of graveyard. You scan the area looking for anything that could either hurt or help you and and find only a large tomb with a strange circle of runes engraved alongthe front. The tomb seems to be for someone important... or dangerous.

-------------
tdt$tomb_roll

You clap your hands together. This monstrosity of a stone might just be able to be moved with enough force. Your walk to the long side and begin to push. (Roll a d20, add your max HP to it. :game_die: â‰¥ 20: gain `tdt$wit_loot 10`)

-------------
tdt$tomb_raider

You decide it isnt worth your while and go looking at the other graves. You find one that has already been dug up and decide to be an opportunist and investigate what was left. Inside you find the remains of what appears to have been a woman. She was burried with her clothes on which consists of safari shorts a strangely cubic t-shirt and her... weapons! (`tdt$wit_loot 10`. Summon 2 Reach enemies and fight them)

-------------
tdt$tomb_speak

You recognize the symbols on the tomb. You decide to speak the enchantment out loud. The symbols light up and create a portal back to champions landing... (You may either: leave the crusade and return to champions landing with ALL your gear and loot {OR} you can make your next floor into a guaranteed shop).
