**__The Shipyard__**
- There isnt any water per say around the gates, more like a strange hot liquid that seems too mineral rich to consume. It gives off the smell of stagnated rust which is why you havent tried swimming or forging through it... that is until you walk onto the landing of a dock. Before you stretches a massive orange river and a stone dock feebly jutting out into it. There are a few buildings scattered here and there that seem abandoned. You could cross this river and save yourself some time... if you could just figure out how to patch up one of the wrecked rafts

tdt$shipyard_raft

You attempt to lug the largest pieces of the boat scrap together to make a raft. You find a few pieces that could work but getting them together might take you more time than you would like. You grit your teeth and get to work. (:game_die: â‰¥ 7: Skip ahead 3 floors, otherwise lose 1 floor and roll again)

The river is dangerous and you arent a ship maker. You decide to focus your attention on the nearby buildings. You fling the door open and give a cautious "Hello?". You find a lantern and light it up to peer through the dark room.You carefully sweep through when you hear a noise behind you... like the sound of a creaking board. Fear grips you as you carefully proceed onwards. You find what seems to be a captains journal and a few gold coins still left hidden in the drawer... You turn to leave when out of the darkness lunges a creature (gain 2d20 <:gold:1058304371940655185>, do a underwash enemy fight. Skip your first turn.)

You scan the area. This place hasnt been out of operation for too long. Whoever was here left in a hurry. You run around back to the old steam generator and flip it on. Thankfully it still has some coals to burn. The lights flash on as you make your way over to the building to find a ship log. (gain 2d20 <:gold:1058304371940655185>, do a underwash enemy fight. The next time you encounter this, immediately pass the raft construction roll).
