**__The Blind__**
- A man sat next to a small caravan perks up as you approach. "Oh please, champion." the man says in a dehydrated voice "spare some coin for a blind man?" You look the man up and down. He is wearing a tattered yellow shawl with withered greyish brown shorts. He smiles up at you.

You furrow your brow. The man's smile is sinister. You throw a piece of gold at his feet doing your best to keep your distance. He doesnt remove his gaze into your face. "Hmmm I dont think that will be enough..." (Roll a :game_die: if it lands on 10 you leave the encounter, otherwise you must keep giving gold until it does. If you are out, use tdt$blind_feeling)

"no" you say to no one in particular. You have seen many a poor man before on your way through the reach but this one isnt normal. You draw you weapon, "No." you say louder. The man looks up at you, its face drops into a disgusted frown, "You greedy worm!" the man says standing up, its skin shedding off like a robe "I will take it for myself!" (Do a fight.)

Your eyes meet the mans. His greyed eyes seem to look through you. You sense something external is tormenting this man. Your eyes narrow into a scowl. The blind man seems to see this as his face shifts from greed to concern to fear. "W-wait a second." he says "you arent a normal pilot are you?" you raise your hand "NO PLEASE WAIT!" it cries out as you place your hand on the man's head "MERCY! LEAVE ME! MERCY" it begins to shriek as it tries to flee through the mans eyes, nose, and mouth. "PLEASE HARBINGER! LET ME LIVE" it cries in a chorus of lost souls. You glare down at the being as light begins to fire from your hand. "NOOOOOOoooo!" it screams one final time before erupting. Light fills the abyss. The man crumples to his knees. The light fades but slowly the man begins to speak, "thank you." he pauses touching your hand "I was so lost." (Dispel ALL will from any allies, gain 1 will)
