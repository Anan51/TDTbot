**__Taskmaster__**
- The gates are bleak. Not much seems to thrive and very few seem to dwell in the dark underground mountain ranges... so hearing the sound of music was more alarming than welcoming. You follow the sound of the music for a while until you see a tent pitched in a clearing. It appears to be a circus. Outside the ring leader is cracking a whip and forcing animals into their cages. You are about to approach when you see the man lose his temper at one of the creatures. He begins violently kicking the cage and shouting angry words at the creature inside. As you approach you hear him say "Starve for all I care!" before he notices you. He turns and looks at you as his face morphs into a smile "erm... Welcome to Bingbee's circus" he waves his arm into the air. The cages are quiet.

tdt$taskmaster_ticket

You shake off the scene before and decide to purchase a ticket. Once inside you see a lot of wonderous creatures and sights all performing death defying tricks and feats of strength and agility. You thought about buying some snacks but its extremely pricey. You enjoyed your time as does a lot of the random patrons that filed in. (-5 :gold:, gain __Empower__ next combat. If you cant afford this, summon 5 Champions_landing_enemy and fight them)

"How much for one of the creatures?" you say pointing at one of the cages. The man looks down at the cages before looking back up at you, "Ah! a man of high class! These creatures are professionally trained and so will follow your command. They took some time to house break but I may want to part with them for say... 30 gold?" (-30 :gold:, on the next combat: summon a champion_landing_enemy to fight along side you. If you cant afford this summon a Gates enemy and fight it.)

The man is still stood there arms in the air expectantly waiting for you to reply. An awkward amount of time passes before you finally speak... your voice is low and grave "Let them go." "I beg pardon?" the man replies. "RELEASE THEM!" You snarl bearing your fangs. The man is startled but only for a moment, "Hahaha awww whats wrong? the little puppy doesnt like the cages?" he says mockingly. You draw your weapon... (Fight a major, if you win upgrade your Fenric passive to: __Fangwild__ :wolf:  ":zap: hits cause __Vulnerable__. Enemies with __Vulnerable__ take double damage." lasts for the rest of this run)
