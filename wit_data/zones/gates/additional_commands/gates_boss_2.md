"So... you found the Sword." Malokai strokes his chin and leans forward "now who gave you that, hmmm?" He rests back into his throne, "you actually want to kill me? to "win"?... well I love to be the bearer of bad news, but I am immortal. No weapon fastened against me will succeed. But... you have potential... why don't you stop wasting your time against me and achieve that potential?" You can feel him tugging at your mind "I offer you unlimited Comprehension Points in exchange for you to end your life... and not to worry, you will have all of those on your next character." He stands up a pair of black and red wings unfurl out from his back "All you need to do is simply bow."

Your hands are shaking. You wonder for a second if a full character reset would be worth the gold and Comp Points, would he even keep his word? Malokai is surely a liar right? Reading this dialog doesn't fill you with confidence either. "Did I just get tricked?" you think to yourself "Did I just throw away this character?" or maybe its simpler than that; "maybe" you think "I can get another character fast enough for it not to matter" but now having read this paragraph you wonder if Malokai was aware of this when making this offer but glancing down your heart sinks. You were lied to. Of course you were, he's a liar. Was it worth it? Maybe. Or maybe you have come back to this option just to see after trying and failing against Malokai's true form... Maybe this is desperation for some kind of answer... you wont know now. Your character, no matter how serious or goofy it was, kneels down before the prince. Immediately a dark force envelops your limbs crawling up along your spine and onto your face. There is a certain warmness to it. Its pleasant. You could just stay like this forever... infinite pleasure and infinite bliss. Is this what the others felt when they succumbed to __will__? (Delete this character from the game. Make a new character and give it a permanent stack of __will__ that cannot be removed)

You draw your weapon and face down the dark prince.
He sighs, "You understand you cannot win this fight, right? I will keep living. You WANT me to keep living. Without me the whole game is over. Nothing to chase. Nothing to work towards. I am an idea, a manifestation of Sin. Without me you have no purpose. This silly little game loses the drive. Look at you, you are playing a game that THOUSANDS of people see and ignore. You are an outcast. Without me this whole game is a waste of time. This excuse for you to live vicariously through the actions of your character, to have a different identity, a different sexuality, a different moral code: gone. To pretend the thoughts and actions of your character are not your own, gone. To Pretend that somehow who you are here is not a reflection of who you are in person: gone. Maybe you embrace that. You try to push out the nagging in the back of your mind that your life will be like a pea under the wheel of the universe. Think about it, I am your meaning. I am a goal simply to be attacked but never truly destroyed, because without me you might have to go back to the real world. To think about the consequences of your actions. And no one, not even He, can tell you what to do right? (either use tdt$malokai_surrender or tdt$gates_boss_3)

The wind howls through the castle as Malokai sees who stands before him, "So you understand. You understand that you cannot win in your own power." Malokai seems frightened. "Fine then." (tdt$gates_boss_4)
