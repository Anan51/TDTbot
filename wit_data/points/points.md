# <:gold:1058304371940655185>  Welcome to the Point Shop <:gold:1058304371940655185> 
**[Take a look at our wares!](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1056365502101979146/1181752362851893330/shop.PNG?ex=658233a7&is=656fbea7&hm=9a5576271ab1a0f66ff7a2cebd439df57560973899fd017f95cc5ddaa3100984&=&format=webp&quality=lossless)** Each item can purchased and used with points. These items do special things in the content and platforms we have!

1. __**How do I earn points?**__
> points are earned through many different means. For example, sometimes I will run a pre-stream prediction on our [Patreon](<https://www.patreon.com/TDTPatreon>) that is free and anyone who predicts correctly earns a point. Sometimes showing up to [events](<https://discord.com/channels/164589623459184640/637134842911260673>) on this discord can earn you a point. Sometimes our [Twitch Streams](<https://www.twitch.tv/tdt_streams>)... you get the idea

2. __**How do I save my points?**__
> Save screenshots of every time you earn points! Make sure your screenshot has as much verifying info as possible but be sure to protect your online identity (dont doxx yourself lol). When you spend them I will ask you to verify them. **IMPORTANT** if you are caught cheating you will be banned without appeal. This includes ANY means of trying to counterfeit points

3. **__Can I pool points with someone or give points?__**
> No. Points earned from one person are LOCKED to that person.

4. **__How do I use the items that are purchased?__**
> You can cash in your points during the end of our YT streams. State what item you are purchasing and be ready for us to ask you to verify with your screenshots. Items are used as soon as they are purchased. I recommend keeping what each item does a secret...

5. **__I see that there are a "stock" of items, how does that work?__**
> Stock refreshes monthly. If an item is sold out, you have to wait till a stream next month
